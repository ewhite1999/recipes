# Veggie Recipes
## Overview
This was created as a christmas gift for my girlfriend. It is a few vegiteraian recipes which are easy to make. It was designed to be viewed on mobile (specifically Chrome, Andrioid) but it does include some styling for desktop.

Each page is generated using JavaScript, with the content coming from a JSON file.
